Requirements:

Write an iPhone application that implements the popular game "Mine Sweeper". 

use a 16 x 16 game grid for this assignment (later, you'll make the game grid user-configurable). 

The game grid should fill available screen space.

Use a double tap gesture to uncover a cell and a single tap gesture to flag a cell as containing a mine.

Must allow the user to start any number of new games without re-starting the application.

If a mine is struck, show the user the location of all the mines and tell the user that the game is lost.

If all unmined cells are uncovered without striking a mine, tell the user that the game is won.

Randomize the location of mines -- don't repeat the same games.
